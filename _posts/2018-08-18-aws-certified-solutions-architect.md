Today I successfully passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam - it was a quite difficult exam to take! 

This is a description of what the test entailed:

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate exam is intended for individuals with experience designing distributed applications and systems on the AWS platform.

This was the second time that I took the test - the first time was back in January of this year. That time, I'd focused mostly on studying the whitepapers (technical documents that Amazon provides), and reading books - in short, mostly striving to understand it from a theoretical perspective. What I quickly learned, however, is that the test is focused pretty heavily on scenario-based questions, and in my opinion that can only really come from getting your hands dirty and really understanding the AWS cloud concepts and services very intimately through hands-on practice.
