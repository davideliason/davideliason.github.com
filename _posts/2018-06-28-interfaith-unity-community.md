There feels like so much tension, anger, division in today's society that I really want to be part of the attempts to create bridges of understanding, and the Interfaith Prayer Breakfast did not disappoint. There were speakers from a variety of faith traditions: Christian (Lutheran, Unitarian, Episcopal),Sikh, Pagan, Islamic, Latin coalition.

To me, the most powerful moment was when Julia Silver got up on the stage with her guitar (inpsiring me to learn guitar once again) and led everybody in a song called 'That We All May Rise'.

Here's the song:

Lots of different groups and voices and opinions, but everyone was standing together in song, and it made me realize that beneath it all many have hearts and desires for shared values and dreams: community, building bridgets, helping each other. Some key words that I heard over and over again were 'love', 'compassion', and 'community' and it felt good to be part of a coming-together of people joining in that spirit.

I did some volunteer work with Immanuel Luther Church over this past winter, and I hadn't realized how severe the problem is with homelessness in the community.
