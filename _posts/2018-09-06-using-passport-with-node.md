Yesterday I build an application that used express to serve up JSON objects as a route as well as full-populated template html files, connected to mlab as mongodb instance. Functionality was limited to create and reads, and hosted on heroku.

This application will build upon that knowledge for full CRUD functionality as well as building in user logins and authentication using passport module.
