I wanted to share how I successfully created an EC2 instance within a VPC instance, using a custom route table and connected to an internet gateway. I find working with the cloud to be super interesting, but there's a lot of moving parts, and I thought it'd be helpful to share this successful step with other interested parties.

So the goal was multifold: to create a VPC, a NACL, A route table, an internet gateway, a subnet, and a security group. Also, to spin up an EC2 instance within one of two subnets, the one which is public facing and internet accessible.
