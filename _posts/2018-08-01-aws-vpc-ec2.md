I wanted to share how I successfully created an EC2 instance within a VPC instance, using a custom route table and connected to an internet gateway. I find working with the cloud to be super interesting, but there's a lot of moving parts, and I thought it'd be helpful to share this successful step with other interested parties.

So the goal was multifold: to create a VPC, a NACL, A route table, an internet gateway, a subnet, and a security group. Also, to spin up an EC2 instance within one of two subnets, the one which is public facing and internet accessible.

Here's the result of this blog's efforts:

The first thing that needs to be done is to create a VPC. Now, I'm assuming that you already have a AWS free-tier account that you can access. Within the VPC Services, you can create a VPC by using a descriptive name tage, and selecting an IPv4 CIDR block. 

The IPv4 CIDR block is basically an IP range that you'll have available to you within your VPC. So what's a VPC? It's like your own virtual private cloud, your own data center. So what we're working on is configuring the network within our own little VPC world :) Just to have more options, I also selected Amazon providing a IPv6 CIDR block as well. And tha's it for creating a VPC! Amazon does some behind-the-scenes work, by creating a default route table, network ACL, and security group as defaults.

Here's what we have so far: a VPC structure, and a few defaults: route table, NACL, security group. Right now the route table, by default, is open to the whole wide world:
