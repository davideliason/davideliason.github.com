I wanted to share how I successfully created an EC2 instance within a VPC instance, using a custom route table and connected to an internet gateway. I find working with the cloud to be super interesting, but there's a lot of moving parts, and I thought it'd be helpful to share this successful step with other interested parties.

So the goal was multifold: to create a VPC, a NACL, a route table, an internet gateway, a subnet, and a security group. Also, to spin up an EC2 instance within one of two subnets, the one which is public facing and internet accessible.

Here's the result of this blog's efforts:

The first thing that needs to be done is to create a VPC. Now, I'm assuming that you already have a AWS free-tier account that you can access. Within the VPC Services, you can create a VPC by using a descriptive name tag, and selecting an IPv4 CIDR block. 

The IPv4 CIDR block is basically an IP range that you'll have available to you within your VPC. So what's a VPC? It's like your own virtual private cloud, your own data center. So what we're working on is configuring the network within our own little VPC world :) Just to have more options, I also selected Amazon providing a IPv6 CIDR block as well. And that's it for creating a VPC! Amazon does some behind-the-scenes work, by creating a default route table, network ACL, and security group as defaults.

Here's what we have so far: a VPC structure, and a few defaults: route table, NACL, security group. Right now the route table, by default, is open to the whole wide world, something that we don't necessarily want and will be fixing next:

Next up, we need to create a *subnet*, which is a logically-distinct area of your VPC. You can have multiple subnets, and they are each their own little kingdom (is how I like to think of it). They can interact with each other using peer sharing, but it's all very controlled. Which is complicated, but super powerful!

Anyways, let's create our subnet! Still within the VPC service category, we do so by selecting a distinctive name, selecting the VPC that we just made, and then selecting a CIDR range (yes, again). Before, we selected 10.0.0.0/16 because that gave the widest range of IP addresses, but now we don't need so many, so we can just select 10.0.1.0/24. Each subnet is associated with a unique Availability Zone (AZ), so you select the AZ that you want this subnet to be in. And, that's all you need to do to create a subnet.

For this exercise, I haven't linked up my subnet with another, I'm just going to focus on getting the single EC2 instance, subnet, route table, NACL, and internet gateway working. Baby steps! :) 

Now, we need to think about the *internet gateway*, because we want to our soon-to-be-provisioned EC2 instance to be able to access the internet. So, once again within the VPC services category, we can create an internet gateway (IG), by simply creating it (give it a name if you like), and attaching it to our VPC.

So, now we have this:
