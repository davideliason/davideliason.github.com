I'm currently building a project for Burning Man...

{% include gallery caption="Rex the robot: conscious, rejected, faithful. What happens after idealism wears off.." %}

Conceptually, I want to explore...

Tecnically, I'll be starting with using a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, Octo adaptor, and WS2811 LED strips and possibly adding more interesting things if things don't go sideways. Baby steps ;)
