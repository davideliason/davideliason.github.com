My name is David Eliason, and I'm a full-stack web developer.

I love exploring the many creative ways that Javascript can be used, both with the web as well as with electronics and microcontrollers to build art and other nifty things.

When not making things, I really like getting outside and backpacking and long-distance bicycle touring.
